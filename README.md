## About me
I used to sneak into statistics classes because I was curious about R thinking that I would graduate and go straight into a PhD in Psychology. I begged my way into an R for Psychology class while on study abroad. Realising that I wanted to take a gap year, I tried to teach myself some more R and python but couldn't afford certifications. Now, I am studying SQL, Python and Power BI through the (free! hallelujah) Data Analytics programme with Generation Ireland.
